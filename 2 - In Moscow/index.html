<h2>Best to see and Do in Moscow</h2>
<h3>Kremlin</h3>
<p>Everyone's heard of the Kremlin but it isn't just the working place of the President. There's actually lots of different parts, including an armoury, a theatre, monastries and so on. The <a href="https://www.kreml.ru/en-Us/museums-moscow-kremlin/">Kremlin Museum's Official Website</a> has a lot more information on what you can find there and about available tickets</p>

<br>


<h3>Red Square and St Basil’s Cathedral</h3>
<p>This needs no explanation, and frankly it's a hard attraction to avoid. Moscow is a city that slowly grew outwards over the course of history and this square finds itself right in the centre as one of the original additions. Extremely beautiful and never fails to take your breath away. Check out <a href="https://en.shm.ru/museum/hvb/">St Basil’s Cathedral's Official Website</a></p>

<br>

<h3>Ice Skating at VDNH</h3>
<p>This is seriously so fun and much cheaper than in the UK so definitely worth it!! Ice skating is such a popular Russian activity and the ice rinks are extremely well looked after. However, be warned – VDNH is the biggest rink in Europe and that is very obvious if you lose track of where your friends skate off to! You can find more information on <a href="https://old.vdnh.ru/en/">VDNH's Official Website</a></p>

<h3>Vorobyovy Gory</h3>
<p>It’s very serene down by the river and you can also enjoy the cable cars for views across Moscow. If you’re scared of heights there is also a very impressive observation deck from which you can see all of Moscow!</p>

<br>
<h3>GUM</h3>
<p>This is the iconic Russian department store, right on Red Square. It has loads of designer shops but that’s not the main attraction. The ceiling is extremely impressive and the store is very well decorated, especially around Christmas time!! 100% worth visiting. Here is the link to <a href="https://gumrussia.com/">GUM's Official Website</a>in case you are feeling curious!</p>

<br>

<h3>Arbat</h3>
<p>All though this has turned very touristy, it is still an important and iconic part of Moscow. You can find all your souvenirs here, as well as the Pushkin Apartment Museum. It’s extremely near Red Square/Okhotny Ryad so worth a visit</p>
