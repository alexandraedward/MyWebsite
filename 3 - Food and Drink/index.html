<h2>Best places for food and drink (and nightlife) in Mosow!</h2>
    <p>I was really lucky to have the chance to live in Mosow as part of my degree and it was probably the best year of my life. Being a student in London is an expensive thing and there is no joy in paying £5 for an average sandwich. Moscow, however, allowed all of us to have the best experiences and not destroy out budgets - so here is a run down of some of my top picks!!</p>
    <h3><u>Food and Drink</u></h3>
    <p><u><b>Novikov</b></u> is a super upmarket restaurant on Tverskaya. This is <i>the</i> place to go, especially if you have an event you want to celebrate. I picked this as the would-have-been venue for my 21st!! </p>
    <img src="https://s.inyourpocket.com/gallery/216370.jpg">
    <p><u><b>Grabli</b></u> is good for tasty Russian food on the go, and is also a stolovaya. It has really hearty portions which is great - though you should be careful not to order too much, as each item is charged individually. They are all over Moscow!</p>
    <img src="https://kudago.com/media/images/event/f2/da/f2dab26877cacb1a8c0d44c8bd8ec811.jpg">
    <p><u><b>Tsvetnoy Bulvar Food Hall</b></u> is located at the top of a shopping centre rammed full with designer clothes - and though the dresses might be out of my budget, the food was actually quite reasonable. This was the place where we saw the <i>most</i> edgy, fashionable young Muscovites!!</p>

    <p><u><b>Depo</b></u> is Europe's largest food hall. It features so many interesting cuisines and is defintely worth visiting, especially at the weekend (musics!!!) Here, only the very best vendors are able to secure a place there - so whatever you order is going to be amazing! </p>

    <p><u><b>Shokoladnitsa</b></u> is a very pleasant coffee shop chain, which makes exciting drinks like lavander lattes. It's really good as a meet up spot to get to know people, but it also does to-go coffee - very convinient!</p>
    <img src="https://f.partnerkin.com/uploads/objimgs/be2d23f84d.jpg">
    <p><u><b>Stolovaya 57</b></u>, in GUM, is a really cool cantine found on the top of the GUM department store (right on Red Square). It's not as cheap as the stolovayas of Saint Petersburg but still worth a stop if you're feeling hungry and wanting some authentic Russian cuisine</p>

    <h3><u>Nightlife</u></h3>
    <p><u><b>GIPSY</b></u> is one of the big flashy nightclubs in Moscow. Face control isn't too strict here but still worth putting an effort into your appearance. Whilst it isn't always the case, women often get free entry but men have to pay many ₽ for entry. It's a super fun night and the inside is massive!! Very good bar for a dance and the vibe is super cooool!</p>
    <img src="https://a-a-ah-ru.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/items/3734/321930/large_BppS-wDxct8.jpg">
    <p><u><b>CHIPS</b></u> is a restaurant and also has a rooftop bar looking over the central Moscow streets below. Drinks aren't the cheapest here so maybe a good shout for a date where you plan on keeping your cool and not getting <i>totally</i> smashed! (The roof top thing is obvs not always possible in the deep deep depths of winter x)</p>
    <img src="http://glossy.ru/uploads/img_8042.jpg">
    <p><u><b>Kamchatka</b></u> was one of the places in Moscow where we could actually strike up conversation with the locals (read: socialising became part of our studies) and this was the most studenty feeling bar we found - even if there were still definitely lots of people older than us. Be ready for your new Russian friends to want to swap instas as that seems to be something they are very keen on here!</p>
    <img src="https://www.silver.ru/LoadedImages/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC3.jpg">
    <p><u><b>Rovesnik</b></u> was one of our favourite bars because the energy here was cool and the drinks were like £2.50 cocktails (read: we tend to buy 8). If you get to the bar later in the evening be prepared for queues but there is some dancing starting from just after 11pm. This place also serves food all day - so if you wanted you could just live here.</p>

    <p><u><b>1929</b></u> is a place for dancing and we really enjoyed ourselves here!! They are known to bring around free jager - also about the experience!! Right in Central Moscow and always full of people. We recommend reserving a table if you plan on coming earlier in the evening. Note: whilst we really love this bar, it is definitely one of the stricter places regarding face control so bear that in mind and don't turn up smashed/badly dressed etc because you don't want to catch the eye of the doormen for the wrong reasons</p>

    <p><u><b>JawsSpot</b></u> is very pleasant roof top bar specialising in beer. Although vodka is the drink most associated with Russia, beer is in fact the most popular. Craft beer is always nice to try and its less than £2 for some of the pints - which is extremely reasonable for the location!</p>
