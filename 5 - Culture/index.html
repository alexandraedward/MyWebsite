        <h2>Culture</h2>
<p>It’s really important to expose yourself to different countries’ cultures in order to understand them. Moscow has such a rich and interesting history and there are some really amazing museums</p>
<h3>Pushkin Museum of Art</h3>
The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts is a museum complex that is currently in possession of around 700,000 pieces of work. This is a collection of non-Russian art and contains an astonishing amount of famous painting. Be prepared, there are always very long queues!!

<h3>Old Tretyakov Gallery</h3>
<p>The Old Tretyakov Gallery’s history starts in 1856 when the Moscow merchant Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov acquired works by Russian artists of his day with the aim of creating a collection, which might later grow into a museum of national art. It is an amazing chance to see so much Russian art that covers so many different periods.</p>

<h3>New Tretyakov Gallery</h3>
<p>The New Tretyakov Gallery is Moscow's premier venue for 20th-century Russian art. Here you can find so many different artists, such as Malevich, Kandinsky, Chagall, Goncharova and Popova. The queues are quite reasonable here in my experience and it is a full day out indeed!! Sometimes there are even art markets set up outside which is very cool!</p>

<h3>Gogol House Museum</h3>
<p>This museum keeps alive the memory of Nikolai Gogol. In this house, the writer worked on the second volume of Dead Souls, and it was also here that he burnt the manuscript. Gogol is one of the most famous Russian writers and this is a museum that is definitely worth a visit. They have audio tours which I would recommend, as there aren’t that many description signs otherwise.</p>

<h3>Pushkin Apartment Museum</h3>
<p>This is a museum of the apartment the writer and poet Alexander Pushkin lived in. I found it really interesting but it does require a bit of imagination since they don’t have any real idea about how the apartment was furnished by him and his wife, Natasha. If you are a massive Pushkin fan and want to have a sense about his tastes, it is more worthwhile to visit his apartment museum in Saint Petersburg which has a lot of original furniture – including the sofa on which he sadly died and his death mask</p>
